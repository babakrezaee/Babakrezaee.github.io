# Estimation and postestimation commands

Below, I list some of postestimation commands that you can use/ need to use after running a Logit model:

## Classification statistics and table
Presents the classification statistics and classification table after logistic,
logit, probit, or ivprobit.
```
use "https://github.com/babakrezaee/POS-604/blob/master/Week2/Braith_statecap_JPR.dta?raw=true", clear
logit ncivwar pop_nc gdp_nc polity2l polity2sq
estat classification

```

## Pearson or Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
Reports the Pearson goodness-of-fit test or the Hosmer –Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
This is a chi-square test, returning a statistics and a P-Value for the null hypothesis that "the fitted model is correct". 

```
estat gof
```
Of course, you should not too much rely on this test, why? See here: https://statisticalhorizons.com/hosmer-lemeshow
