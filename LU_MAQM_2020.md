The Methods in Political Science course aims to sharpen students’ knowledge of research designs and methods in order for them to successfully complete their Master thesis projects. The course also has a strong practical focus and guides students in applying specific methods to address their research questions by means of concrete exercises.
In the framework of the course students are required to choose one of the following working groups:

Quantitative research methods: this working group will focus on the use of linear (OLS) and logistic regression analysis, techniques for working with complex survey and country-level data (e.g. cluster correction, weights), and basic multilevel analysis (random intercept models). Qualitative research methods: this working group will focus on the objectives and application of multiple qualitative methods including (elite) interviewing, discourse analysis, and historical research/secondary data analysis.
