# Estimation and postestimation commands

Assume that we estimate following Logit model:

```
use "https://github.com/babakrezaee/POS-604/blob/master/Week2/Braith_statecap_JPR.dta?raw=true", clear

logit ncivwar pop_nc gdp_nc polity2l polity2sq i.anocracy
```

Below, I list some of postestimation commands that you can use/ need to use after running a Logit model:

## Classification statistics and table
Presents the classification statistics and classification table after logistic,
logit, probit, or ivprobit.
```
estat classification

```

## Pearson or Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
Reports the Pearson goodness-of-fit test or the Hosmer –Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
This is a chi-square test, returning a statistics and a P-Value for the null hypothesis that "the fitted model is correct". 

```
estat gof
```
Of course, you should not too much rely on this test, why? See [here!](https://statisticalhorizons.com/hosmer-lemeshow) 


## Compute area under ROC curve and graph the curve
Graphs the ROC curve and calculates the area under the curve.

We later will discuss this more in class.

```
lroc
```

## Display information criteria

We usually use Akaike’s Information Criteria (AIC) and  Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are widely used in model selection criteria.
The "best" model among all of your estimated models *based on AIC and BIC* index is the model with the mallest AIC or/and BIC.

```
estat ic
```

## Marginal effects

### Marinal effects of a categorical variable
The idea here simply is: given your estimated model, how the outcome variable changes for any given changes in the independent variable. 

If your independent variabl is categorical, then you just simply need to write rigt after running your regression. In our example, anocracy is a dummy variable, so we have:

```
margins anocracy
marginsplot
```
Typying *marginsplot* after *margins* plots the estimated margins.

### Marginal effects of a continuois variable
Now try to estimate the marginal effect of GDP, i.e. gdp_nc, on the outcome variable. Run the regression again, and then type:

```
margins gdp_nc

```

If you did it correctly, you should get an error. The problem is that there infinite numbers associated with a continuois variable, so STATA does not know for which value of GDP calculates the marginal effects. Now, let's tell STATA that you want to know how the margianl effects of GDP on the outcome variable changes from its min to max value.

```
margins, at(gdp_nc=(5.5(.5)10))
marginsplot
```
margins, at(gdp_nc=(5.5(.5)10)) estimates the marginal effects of GDP on the dependent variable for gdp_nc=5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, ..., 9.5, 10.
