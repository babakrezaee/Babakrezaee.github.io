 This course trains students to use statistical models for forecasting societal, mainly political, outcomes.
 The students learn how to use Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms to explore topics such as measuring
 the extent of partisan polarization, predicting electoral outcomes, predicting local violence, analyzing the trend of interstate war,
 and forecasting civil war. Subjects to be covered include understanding the differences and similarities between Correlation Analysis, Causal Inference, and Forecasting Principles; Naive Bayes; k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN); Regularized Linear Regression (Lasso, Ridge, eNet); forecasting using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE); Trees methods; Clustering; and Dimension Reduction. 
 

## Week 1:  Correlation Analysis vs.  Causal Inference vs.  Prediction/Forecasting
* A few of *R Markdown* cheetsheets: [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) and [here](https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/math/statistics/sfs/Education/Advanced%20Studies%20in%20Applied%20Statistics/course-material-1719/Datenanalyse/rmarkdown-2.pdf). There are small differences between _GitHub Markdown_ and _R Markdown_. [Here](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) is a cheetsheet for _GitHub Markdown_.

* If you need to refrsh your mind on statistics and mathemetics for this course, you may go over the handout of [Political Science PhD Math Camp](https://github.com/babakrezaee/MethodsCourses/blob/master/Political%20Science%20Graduate%20Mathematics%20and%20Statistics%20Boot%20Camp/PoliSciMathCamp_2018.pdf) I prepared and taught at Arizona State Univeristy.
