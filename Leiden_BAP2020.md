# The Environmental Causes of Conflict-RezaeeDaryakenari
=====

How does the environment affect peace and conflict? An emerging consensus within the policy circles recognizes the effects of climate change as a severe threat to international security and world peace. There are, also, plenty of reports and research on how rebel groups all around the world finance their operation using the revenue from natural resources such as oil, gold, diamond, and Coca. In this course, we will explore the relationship between climate and natural resources on one side and political conflict and violence on the other side. 

The first part of the course (Block III) is designed to start with unpacking the meaning of environment and conflict as two rather elusive concepts, which scholars conceptualized and measured differently. Then, we will study and discuss the literature on environmental security aiming to answer three main questions. First, how do climate change and weather anomalies as well as resource scarcity and abundance contribute to and amplify conflict? Second, how does conflict affect the environment and exacerbate environmental issues? Finally, how can we ease and possibly resolve environment-related conflicts? We will conclude the first part of the course in Blok III by discussing the different methodological approaches that scholars and practioners use for studying environmental security threats.

In addition to lectures, the course is designed to encourage class discussions and student participation in group activities. Each student will write two written assignments in Block III. One is a response essay that critiques the assigned readings to one session of the course. The second essay is a short essay on the research question that you will explore in the second part of the course (Block IV). This assignment asks you to discuss the importance of your question and the feasibility of exploring it. Building on this proposal, you will formulate your research question and research design to conduct your research and write your bachelor thesis in the second part of the course (Block IV). We will schedule several individual meetings during Block IV so that you can report the progress of your research and receive feedback as well as discuss the possible challenges you face.

Reading list:
The readings list include academic articles and policy reports. Once it is finalized, the instructor will share the reading list and syllabus on his GitHub page for this course: https://babakrezaee.github.io/Leiden_BAP2020
