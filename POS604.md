# Estimation and postestimation commands

Below, I list some of postestimation commands that you can use/ need to use after running a Logit model:

## Classification statistics and table
Presents the classification statistics and classification table after logistic,
logit, probit, or ivprobit.
```
use "https://github.com/babakrezaee/POS-604/blob/master/Week2/Braith_statecap_JPR.dta?raw=true", clear
logit ncivwar pop_nc gdp_nc polity2l polity2sq
estat classification

```

## Pearson or Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
Reports the Pearson goodness-of-fit test or the Hosmer –Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
This is a chi-square test, returning a statistics and a P-Value for the null hypothesis that "the fitted model is correct". 

```
estat gof
```
Of course, you should not too much rely on this test, why? See [here!](https://statisticalhorizons.com/hosmer-lemeshow) 


## Compute area under ROC curve and graph the curve
Graphs the ROC curve and calculates the area under the curve.

We later will discuss this more in class.

```
lroc
```

## Display information criteria

We usually use Akaike’s Information Criteria (AIC) and  Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are widely used in model selection criteria.
The "best" model among all of your estimated models *based on AIC* index is the model with the mallest AIC.
